10 Web Development Frameworks Full-Stack Software Engineer Can Learn in 2019

 
The Technical world changes as fast the technology changes, and so is the technical jobs. Gone are the days where you can land a job by just knowing one technology or programming language, and somehow to survive in the job for many years without learning new things. Many of us get into programming and web development world by knowing just one or two technology like Java, C++, or JavaScript, but that won't cut the ice anymore. There were teams of tens of people doing specialized jobs, e.g. front-end development is done by a separate set of developers and back-end is written by other sets of programmers, commonly known as server-side developers.

In today's competitive world, everybody is looking for Full Stack Software Engineers, i.e. someone who knows both front-end and back-end technology and can work independently to develop a fully functional web application.

If you look at the job description fo any Full Stack Software Engineer job on Internet-based companies you will find that a full-stack software engineer is expected to know front-end technologies like ES-next, Babel, React, Redux, Bootstrap, LESS etc and back-end skill like Python, Django, Graphene (GraphQL), REST, MySQL, DynamoDB, Redis, Docker etc.

In other word expectation has gone very high, in the old days you can become a front-end developer by just knowing HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript but not anymore and that's why it's important to be familiar with a different set of technologies even if you are not expert of those.

If you are a full-stack Software engineer or someone who aspire to become a full-stack Software engineer then you should be familiar with a couple of front-end and back-end web development framework like React and Node, but that also depends upon your background, e.g. whether you are primarily from Python background or Java/JavaScript background.

It's better to learn the framework which is compatible with your primary skill like a Python developer should benefit more from learning Django then learning Angular. Similarly, a JavaScript developer should learn to React and Node JS rather than learning Django and Node JS.
