## PROJECT

we will use the following libraries.

    Vert.x web as while the Vert.x core library does support the creation of HTTP servers, it does not provide elegant APIs to deal with routing, handling of request payloads, etc.

    Vert.x JDBC client to provide an asynchronous API over JDBC.

    Apache FreeMarker to render server-side pages as it is an uncomplicated template engine.

    Txtmark to render Markdown text to HTML, allowing the edition of wiki pages in Markdown.
