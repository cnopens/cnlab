TypeScript Tutorial

```
TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you really want to. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java. The popular JavaScript framework Angular 2.0 is written in TypeScript. Mastering TypeScript can help programmers to write object-oriented programs and have them compiled to JavaScript, both on server side and client side.
